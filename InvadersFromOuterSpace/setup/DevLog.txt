_Atm I'm trying to get the Bullet to spawn from the player, but its position seems to be set to (0,0) for some unknown reason.
_I think it might have something to do with the setup of the Bullet class - the constructor with and without arguments, 
those are to me still rather confusing. For sure there the position needs to be specified somehow. 
_Then when this works, I believe it's on to make extensions of the Bullet class, instead of using the class directly, 
so that we can keep shooting the bullets one after another, and not simply be using the same over and over, 
which can bring the same bullet that was shot back to player(no good). 
_Need to find out how to destroy the rectangle(Objects) that has reached outside of the screen.

_Can't get the Explosion class to be called into the Setup-file.

_Trying to run with collision, but get Null, probably because the bullet does not exist at start, until we fire.

_Can't get the Enemy-object to move according to the if:s in the Enemy-file, under movement(). 
- Now I got it to move correctly, however, way too fast - probably due to it being moved every frame, should find a 
	way to use deltaTime for this instead. 
- It now does the whole movement() every 2 seconds, but still runs the movement() too fast. 
- It might also have something to do with that it is the "translate()" that is being moved.
- Maybe I shouldn't be using a for-loop? maybe just using if:s are better: checking if true or compare a progress-value, 
	then do until it reaches a limit, from going to right then onto next move, say down, then left, down, right, etc. 
	Loop like that.

_For-loop for the bullets has a limited ammo, want to have it reset at some point or at least be infinite somehow.

_Needs to be implemented:
- Start Menu.*
- HP / Lives
- Game Over.
- Highscore.
- GUI : - Score, - Highscore, - Lives.
- Several Enemies moving simultaneously.
- Enemies should randomly shoot at Player.

_Needs to be finished:
- Explosion effect. 
- Collision. *
- Unlimited ammo(but restricted to 1 shot per second).*
- Bullets should be removed when colliding, that or be hidden until spawned again.*
- Enemies should spawn at different positions

_Notes:
- Just ended with tinkering in the Explosion-file - Centering the images and giving renderExp() the aguments (float x, float y),
	and in the renderExp() (under it on its first lines(37-39)) I define the floats' values to be used to set the position of the
	explosion to the enemy's when colliding.

- For now I made the enemy "disappear" by making its size to 0, and the same goes for the Bullets.


_Need Help with:
- How to get each enemies[i] to spawn at different locations?
- Does the Explosion animation play through?
- Can we use the same code for the Enemy's bullet to shoot at the player randomly? Do we use an extension in that case? How do we
	tell the extension to move in the opposite direction?
- What does the push() and pop() actually do? Why are they used?

_Needs to be implemented:
- Enemies shoot at player,*
- GUI - score*/health*/  HIGHSCORE,
- win screen/emilie - if -or else,
- Game over if stars fall down, change boolean if star below y.*

_Need help with:*
- How to tell the spawning of the enemies[i] to change.*


_Questions:
- How is it that, in GameManager from line 106-215, that the first for-loop which is according to the length of the bullets-array, 
	which is only 1 in size, that it can go through each of the enemies, which are 33 in total (11 + 11 + 11 (3 rows))? 
	Doesn't it go through only 1 in the loop? Shouldn't it have to be at least as many times to check times how many it's checking?
	Is that why the next/second for-loop is checking as many times as there is enemies?

- Why can't I nullify enemies[j] but bullets[i] in GameManager, under collision detection? Think this creates an issue with the bullet
	colliding with the enemy even though it is invisible..	

- How to make the button for Start Game to only be clickable on the actual button, and not able to click above it like we can now?
