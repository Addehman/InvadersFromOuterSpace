_Atm I'm trying to get the Bullet to spawn from the player, but its position seems to be set to (0,0) for some unknown reason.
_I think it might have something to do with the setup of the Bullet class - the constructor with and without arguments, 
those are to me still rather confusing. For sure there the position needs to be specified somehow. 
_Then when this works, I believe it's on to make extensions of the Bullet class, instead of using the class directly, 
so that we can keep shooting the bullets one after another, and not simply be using the same over and over, 
which can bring the same bullet that was shot back to player(no good). 
_Need to find out how to destroy the rectangle(Objects) that has reached outside of the screen.
